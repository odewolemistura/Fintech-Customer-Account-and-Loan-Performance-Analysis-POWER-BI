# Fintech Customer & Loan Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview

This project explores customer profiles, account activities, and loan performance using Power BI. The aim is to provide business insights into customer behavior and credit performance to support better product offerings, risk management, and marketing strategies.

The analysis is split into two pages:
1. **Customer & Account Insights**
2. **Loan & Credit Performance**

## üìÅ Data Source

The dataset was obtained from **Kaggle**. It contains synthetic records on:
- Customer demographics and financial behavior  
- Account activities (balance, deposits, withdrawals, transfers)  
- Loan application summaries (loan amounts, status, interest, purpose)  
- Investment goals and risk tolerance  

## üõ† Tools Used

- **Power BI** ‚Äì For visualization and dashboard creation  
- **Power Query (inside Power BI)** ‚Äì For data cleaning and transformation  

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

Performed in **Power Query**, the cleaning process involved:
- Removing irrelevant columns  
- Standardizing and formatting text and numeric values  
- Ensuring correct data types  
- Renaming columns for clarity  
- Rearranging columns logically  
- Grouping:
  - **Age ranges** (e.g., 18‚Äì29, 30‚Äì44, 45-64, 65+ etc.)
  - **Income levels** (Low, Medium, High)
